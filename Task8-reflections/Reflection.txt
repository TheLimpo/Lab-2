1. I learned alot. This Lab2 was harder than lab1 by alot.
Especially to print a 2d array with user input. Lots of googling. Everything took more time.

2. But for me this lab 2 instructions was in some cases very weird. 
It's hard to know exactly what you guys wanted cuz alot of the tasks was open for interpetations.
Example:
In alot of tasks it said that a function should take an int array as a parameter.
or something similar.
And that made it seem like the function ONLY took that parameter. 
But I couldn't for love of me find a way to some of the functions to ONLY take one parameter.
So I had to make the functions take more parameters. Other people did the same.
So if you want a specific number of parameters or not. It may be better to write that.
Atleast make it clear that it doesn't take only one parameter. 

Task 7 in some cases doesn't make sense. What to copy and not and so on. 
Linking was not a problem for me. 

3. Time: This lab took more time. Maybe like 25 hours.
